# Project Roadmap

## Current state of project (V0.1)

The project is currently in pre-production (i.e. beta).  There are a number of critical items that need to be addressed before it can move to the production state; these include:
1. [Nuget package not available](https://github.com/hypertherm/DotNet.SystemCollections.Analyzers/issues/58)
2. [SCA0006 - Only trigger an error notification to developers when First/FirstOfDefault is invoked with a Func delegate](https://github.com/hypertherm/DotNet.SystemCollections.Analyzers/issues/64)

## Future version of project

### Version 1.0

At this state of the project, the project will be in production and will provide a helpful suite of analyzers for Collections in System.Collections and LINQ extension methods in System.Linq.

### Version 2.0

This version of the project will add code fixes for those analyzer rules that are straight forward but tedious to fix manually.  Users can also expect more analyzers, based on their feedback.
